# Néstor's Web Portfolio

## About the project

A simple web development project. This repository is meant to function as a time machine, documenting how my web skills evolve over time. See you soon! 🙌

It is divided into small projects, each serving as a practice for foundations of different skills, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- **Current Status:** For now, it features HTML-focused projects.
- **Coming Soon:** CSS and JavaScript projects will be added shortly as my learning progresses.
