    <p>
      Welcome to my Web Portfolio! This is where I share my web development
      projects and track my progress. I created this site to document how my
      skills evolve over time—almost like a time machine. I'm excited to see
      what I'll build next and how I'll grow as a developer. See you soon! 🙌
