    <h3>A Creative Mind</h3>

    <p>
      In his doctoral thesis, Georg Cantor wrote that "in mathematics, the art
      of asking questions is more valuable than solving problems" (Cantor,
      1867). It is no surprise, then, the boldness with which he delved into
      research that many considered foolish, especially if we remember that he
      was trained in mid-19th century Germany, when the neo-humanist movement
      encouraged mathematicians to think in more creative, imaginative, and
      abstract ways.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this intellectual curiosity, Cantor dared to
      challenge the status quo by asking: "Does the same amount of natural
      numbers (\(\mathbb{N}\)) exist as real numbers (\(\mathbb{R}\))?".
    </p>

    <h3>Are There the Same Number of Women as Men in the Country?</h3>

    <p>
      To understand how Cantor arrived at his answer, first consider a more
      everyday case: how do you know if there are more women than men in the
      country? Counting them would seem the most direct way, but it would be an
      enormous task. A more practical alternative consists of pairing each woman
      with a man: if there are men left over, there are more men; if there are
      women left over, there are more women; and if no one is left over, both
      quantities are equal (Lemismath, 2017).
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cantor did something similar with sets. Instead of
      counting their elements, he established one-to-one correspondences to
      determine which set was truly larger. Thus, he discovered that there are
      infinities that, although different at first glance, have the same size
      and, furthermore, that there are infinities strictly greater than others.
    </p>

    <h3>Countably Infinite Sets</h3>

    <p>Think of the natural numbers and the perfect squares:</p>
    <p>$$\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, \dots\}$$</p>
    <p>$$\square^2 = \{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, \dots\}$$</p>
    <p>
      At first glance, it might seem that there are more naturals than perfect
      squares. But, by pairing them like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      $$\{\mathbb{N}, \square^2\} = \{\{1,1\}, \{2,4\}, \{3,9\}, \{4,16\},
      \dots, \{n,n^2\}, \dots\},$$
    </p>
    <p>
      none are left without a partner. That is to say, there are as many perfect
      squares as there are natural numbers! In fact, Cantor proved that
      \(\mathbb{N}\), \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(\mathbb{Q}\), and \(\square^2\) have the
      same quantity of elements.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any set that can be paired one-to-one with
      \(\mathbb{N}\) is called countably infinite and is represented by
      \(\aleph_0\) (Aleph-null).
    </p>

    <h3>
      Are There More Numbers in the Interval \((0,1)\) or in the Naturals?
    </h3>

    <p>
      After this breakthrough, Cantor decided to compare the real numbers with
      the natural numbers. To simplify, he restricted the problem to the
      interval \((0,1)\). He paired both sets in the following way:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>\(1 \rightarrow 0.100000\dots\)</li>
      <li>\(2 \rightarrow 0.120000\dots\)</li>
      <li>\(3 \rightarrow 0.123000\dots\)</li>
      <li>\(...\)</li>
      <li>\(n \rightarrow 0.123456\dots n000\dots\)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Cantor showed that, from this list, an unpaired number can always be
      constructed. The rule is simple: for the \(n\)-th decimal of the new
      number, take the \(n\)-th decimal of the \(n\)-th number and change it to
      any other digit. A possible number would be \(0.23456\dots
      [n+1]000\dots\), which differs from the first in its first decimal, the
      second in its second, and so on.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proves that in the interval \((0,1)\) there
      are numbers that cannot be paired with the naturals: the set of reals in
      \((0,1)\) is much larger than \(\mathbb{N}\). In reality, infinitely
      larger. Infinities greater than others exist!
    </p>

    <h3>Conflict between Peers</h3>

    <p>
      When Cantor published these ideas, a large part of the mathematical
      community rejected them. Even Leopold Kronecker, his former mentor,
      described his conclusions as unacceptable.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resistance was due to the dominant
      idea of infinity being the one taught in basic courses (limits, series,
      integrals). This is now called potential infinity: a quantity that can
      grow or decrease without limit. However, operating with it leads to
      indeterminate forms like \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\) or \(\infty - \infty\).
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, many mathematicians
      refused to accept infinity as an entity with its own size. In the words of
      Carl Friedrich Gauss: "The use made of an infinite magnitude as a real
      entity is never admissible in mathematics. Infinity is only a way of
      speaking."
    </p>

    <h3>Impact on Mathematics</h3>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the controversy over his mathematics, combined with nervous
      breakdowns and the deaths of his mother, brother, and youngest son, led
      him to spend much of his life in the Halle psychiatric hospital.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, over time, the scientific community began
      to recognize the value of Cantor's work. Today, much of modern mathematics
      is based on Set Theory, which could not have developed without his
      discoveries. Cantor allowed mathematicians to touch infinity.
